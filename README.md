MY ANALYSIS
Firstly, let's look at the most frequently made films. We see that action, comedy, drama, and horror films are made much more frequently than other genres. Action films require high budgets to achieve the quality that can be watched. However, in my analysis, they do not achieve much income due to budget constraints.

Comedy films see incredible levels of budget allocation according to their genre. Although they receive very low box office success, the difference between film budgets can be mitigated by making budgetary restrictions based on box office revenue, thereby potentially increasing their income.

The same applies to drama films. They seem to receive relatively high budgets, and although their percentage of income is average, the sheer number of drama films being produced suggests they are made not purely for financial gain but rather as a tool to satisfy certain audiences or convey specific messages.

Now, let's discuss the genre with the highest income potential from our data table: horror films. Horror films appear to have accustomed investors to taking cautious steps. Despite facing budget constraints, they achieve high percentage-based success. I don't believe this success is solely due to budget constraints. In my view, a high-budget, quality horror movie could also achieve significant box office success. It's unacceptable for such a popular genre to rank among the lowest in terms of budget allocation.

Additionally, the choice of release dates for films is notable. Films released in October, November, and December are less preferred, possibly due to competing with films released earlier in the year that have completed their cycle of critical and financial success. Starting fresh in a new year may be seen as a more strategic approach to achieving success throughout the year.

Furthermore, actors' repeated casting choices are influenced by their previous roles. An actor who has consistently appeared in horror movies may be favored for another horror movie, just as action movie stars tend to be cast repeatedly in similar roles. Of course, this analysis is not that simple; countless other factors could be added to further refine it. This concludes my analysis based on the limited data in my table.

Lastly, I am a fan of Rose Byrne.
